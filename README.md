# Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard created using Tableau to visualize and analyze sales performance data for a hypothetical superstore. The primary goal is to identify key drivers of profit and sales trends, providing actionable insights for business improvement and strategic decision-making. The dashboard allows users to explore various dimensions of the superstore's data in an interactive and intuitive way.

## Key Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations to explore different aspects of the superstore's sales data:
